Pharmacy Management System (C Language)

This is a simple console-based project developed in C as part of my CS-191: Programming with C course.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Admin and User login system. 
Add, edit, delete, and search medicine records. 
View medicine list. 
File handling for data storage (no database used). 
This was my first programming project, built to strengthen my understanding of C language fundamentals and practical coding.
